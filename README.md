# Heart Disease Dataset Analysis
This repository contains code and visualizations for the analysis of a heart disease dataset. The dataset includes various health attributes of individuals, such as age, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and fasting blood sugar.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset (HeartDiseaseTrain-Test.csv) has been preprocessed and cleaned to remove any missing values, ensuring the data is ready for analysis.

Analysis
The analysis focuses on exploring key statistics and trends related to heart disease. Visualizations have been created to better understand the distribution of various features and their potential relationships with heart disease.

Visualizations Included:
1. Bar Plot: Chest Pain Type Distribution Visualizes the distribution of different types of chest pain among individuals.
2. Pie Chart: Fasting Blood Sugar Distribution Depicts the distribution of fasting blood sugar levels among individuals.
3. Scatter Plot: Age vs. Max Heart Rate Explores the relationship between age and maximum heart rate, with color indicating the presence of heart disease.
4. Correlation Heatmap Illustrates correlations between different health attributes. Notable observations include a moderate positive correlation between maximum heart rate and heart disease occurrence.
5. Violin Plot: Exercise Induced Angina by Age Compares the distribution of individuals with exercise-induced angina.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis or explore the visualizations further, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Run the provided Jupyter Notebook (Statistics and Trends.ipynb) to execute the code and generate the visualizations.

## Contribution
Contributions to enhance the analysis, add new visualizations, or improve the code are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
